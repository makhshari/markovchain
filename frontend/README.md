# Frontend with React JS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Make sure you have latest version of node installed. Also, you should have a node package manager installed. Having either [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) is recommended.

# Steps to have frontend up and running:

- First in the root directory, simply run:
```npm install```
or 
``` yarn install ```

- Now, you should be able to see the node_modules directory in the root directory.
- Simply run  ```yarn start```  or ``` npm start ``` to have the frontend up and running on: 

These commands will Run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### NOTE:
If you're running your API server on any address other than ```localhost:8080```, make sure that you change the configs in the global constants file at ```src/globals.js```.

# UI External Library
- This project uses [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for most of the UI components (Buttons, TextFields)
- For showing the generated output text like a type-writer, this project utilizes [react-typewriter-effect](https://github.com/kevoese/react-typewriter-effect) package.




## Other Available Scripts

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
